## Overview
This project is a case study that analyzes grocery product sales across various outlets using Tableau. The analysis aims to uncover customer behavior insights, track sales trends, and evaluate performance metrics. These insights help inform operational improvements, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize product offerings and store layouts at Blinkit.

## Dataset
The dataset, named **Grocery Sales**, is in `.CSV` format and contains 12 columns of data related to grocery sales across different outlets.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis include:
1. Import data from the **Grocery Sales** table into Tableau.
2. Identify the **Top 10 selling items** by their total sales.
3. Visualize the impact of **outlet type** on average sales.
4. Analyze **sales performance** across different outlet locations.
5. Display the **distribution of item fat content** using a Donut chart.
6. Show how the **age of outlets** (year of establishment) affects sales performance using a line chart.
7. Identify the **top-selling item types** by total sales.
8. Visualize the **average MRP by item types**.
9. Create **KPIs** for Total Sales, Average MRP, and Number of Items.

## Insights
The visualizations generated during the analysis revealed several key insights that support data-driven decision-making at Blinkit:

- **Top-Selling Items**: Certain product categories, such as **Fruits and Vegetables** and **Snacks**, consistently generate higher revenue, indicating customer preferences for these items.
  
- **Outlet Performance**: Sales vary significantly by **outlet type**, with some outlet categories demonstrating consistently higher average sales, which can guide store planning and inventory management.
  
- **Location-Based Trends**: Sales performance differs across **geographic locations**. Tier 3 outlets recorded the highest total sales, highlighting the importance of localized strategies for different market tiers.
  
- **Product Fat Content**: The **distribution of item fat content** is predominantly in the low-fat category, suggesting consumer interest in healthier products or a product lineup catered toward health-conscious customers.

- **Outlet Age Impact**: Outlets with a longer **operational history** (older establishments) showed varied performance, with some older outlets outperforming newer ones in total sales. This suggests the value of customer loyalty and established brand presence in certain areas.

- **Top-Selling Item Types**: The analysis of **item types** revealed that particular categories like **Household Items** and **Frozen Foods** are significant contributors to overall sales, providing a focus for promotional strategies.

- **Price Distribution**: The **average MRP** varies considerably across different product categories, offering insights into pricing strategies and customer purchase behavior for both premium and budget-friendly products.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Important KPIs, such as **Total Sales**, **Average MRP**, and **Number of Items Sold**, provide a high-level overview of the company's overall performance and can be used to track progress over time.

## Conclusion
The Blinkit Grocery Product Analysis demonstrates the power of data-driven insights in optimizing product offerings, improving store layouts, and better understanding customer preferences. The findings reveal significant trends in top-selling products, the impact of outlet location and type on sales, and the importance of customer loyalty in older outlets. By leveraging these insights, Blinkit can refine its marketing and operational strategies to enhance customer satisfaction, boost sales, and streamline business processes.
